My Dot Files
============

This project is a collection of my personal dot files. I put them here so
that they can be used as a guide for others. Also hosting them on GitHub
makes it easy for me to sync them across many different machines.

`Git`_
======

.. _Git: http://git-scm.com/

The files below are my configuration files for git.

.gitconfig
----------

This file sets up git at a global level. The bullets below outline my
configuration options.

* set my name and email
* turn on color output
* pack with as many thread as there are CPU cores
* don't limit the number of renames tracked
* use my global excludes file
* setup some handy aliases:

  * st = status
  * ci = commit
  * co = checkout
  * br = branch

* use the `opendiff`_ tool to merge
* setup upstream tracking by default
